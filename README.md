# twitter interface

using twitter API to grab images and map them

## papers  
- Photo Geolocation with Convolutional Neural Networks [link](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45488.pdf).
Uses LSTM to improve geolocation of photos with high temporal proximity e.g. photo album sequences.

- accounts that post geolocated updates
- data point or path?

need to georeference image to crs - possible with computed GCPs?
